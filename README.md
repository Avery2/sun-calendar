## üíª Dev Usage + Notes

- To generate the isc file, run `create_calendar_local.py`
    - Uses this awesome free sun API: https://sunrise-sunset.org/api
    - Uses isc python library https://icspy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- The isc file is exposed by hosting on GH pages
- Location is set to San Francisco by default
- If you want to use a different location, change the lat and long coordinates in `create_calendar_local.py`
    - You can get the lat and long coordinates from google maps by right clicking
    - If you want it to auto-update, you'll have to fork this and host it on your own github pages. You'll have to update the workflow file to point to your repo too.
- This only loads data for a week and it runs a cron job every three days to stay updated using GitHub workflows.
